How will you use XML? Please be specific and tell me more about your career and interests.

Hints - you get 1 point for questions 1 -25, and 5 points for the bonus question. I'm looking for short answers in the first 25 questions, then your imagination in the bonus question. The total possible score is thus 30 points, out of 25 for the assignment.

If you can't find an answer then you haven't learned to use http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/, whatis.com or Google.com. Also try http://www.xml.com/ , http://www.xml.org/ or http://builder.com.com/ but remember that whatis.com will be hyperlinked to other subjects.

Good luck!

Please attempt the bonus question as it works in your favor, and it affects the entire exam score. This is due on or about June 6th, 2006.
